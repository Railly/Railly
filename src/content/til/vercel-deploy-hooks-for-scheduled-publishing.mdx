title: "Vercel Deploy Hooks Solve SSG Scheduled Publishing"

Static sites can't publish posts at a future date because pages only exist if they're generated at build time. No build = no page = 404.

The fix: Vercel Deploy Hooks. You create a hook URL in your project settings, and hitting it with a POST triggers a fresh production deploy. Combine that with a `vercel.json` cron job that calls your hook daily, and your SSG site rebuilds itself automatically.

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/rebuild",
      "schedule": "0 12 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

The API route just fetches the deploy hook URL and authenticates with `CRON_SECRET`. I use this on my Astro blog to auto-publish "premiere" posts at their `pubDate` -- the countdown disappears and the article goes live, zero manual intervention.
