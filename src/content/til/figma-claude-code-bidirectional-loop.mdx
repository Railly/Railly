Figma's "Code to Canvas" plugin enables a full round-trip between design and code via MCP.

`/implement-design` extracts layout, typography, colors from any Figma frame and generates code for your stack. `generate_figma_design` serializes your running page's DOM into real editable Figma layers (not a screenshot).

```
Figma frame → /implement-design → component
    ↑                                  ↓
edit in Figma              generate_figma_design
    ↑                                  ↓
get_design_context ← editable Figma layers
```

Gotcha: Code to Figma still needs a browser render with a capture script injected. Not purely automatic from code.
