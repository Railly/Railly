Built a 3-agent dev team (Bolt codes, Sage reviews, Nova researches) and hit every classic engineering management problem: ownership, concurrency limits, routing, queues.

Conway's Law applies to AI teams too — your agent architecture mirrors the communication structure you design. The review loop proved it: Bolt opens PR, Sage reviews, Bolt fixes, repeat. Had to cap at 3 iterations because without a kill switch, two agents argue forever.

Don't think of multi-agent systems as "parallel workers." Think of them as a team. Roles, boundaries, escalation paths, termination conditions.
