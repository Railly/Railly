Agent skills load context in three levels: metadata (~100 tokens) at startup, full instructions (under 5,000 tokens) when triggered, and resources only as needed.

This is why skills beat `.cursorrules` - it loads entire contents into every conversation. A skill with 60+ product references only loads what's relevant. Cloudflare-skill has 60 reference files but you can ask about Workers without paying for WAF documentation.
