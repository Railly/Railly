Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI agents to external systems. Think of it as "USB-C for AI applications" - a universal connector.

Before MCP, every agent needed custom integrations for every service (N×M problem). MCP creates a standardized interface so one MCP server for Postgres works with any MCP-compatible agent. Agents discover tools dynamically via protocol.
