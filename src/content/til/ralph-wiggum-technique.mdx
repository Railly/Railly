Autonomous AI coding loop that ships features while you sleep. Named after The Simpsons character - embodies persistent iteration despite setbacks.

The core insight: context pollution is inevitable. Ralph doesn't try to clean memory - it throws it away and starts fresh. Progress persists via files + git. Failures evaporate.

```bash
while :; do cat prompt.md | agent ; done
```

Each iteration reads task list, picks highest priority, implements, runs tests, commits if passing, logs learnings, repeats.
