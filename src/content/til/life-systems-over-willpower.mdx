Willpower fluctuates with stress, fatigue, and hunger. Instead of relying on it, build automated if-then rules that remove decision-making.

Nearly half of daily decisions are already autonomous (habits). Create explicit rules: "if 7am, work out" - no decision needed. Every choice taxes mental energy. High performers don't have more willpower - they remove choice entirely.
