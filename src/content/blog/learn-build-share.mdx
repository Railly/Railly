I was invited to speak at the [**IV Encuentro de Graduados de la UNMSM**](https://viceacademico.unmsm.edu.pe/?news=unmsm-realizara-el-iv-encuentro-de-confraternidad-y-vinculacion-de-egresados-y-graduados) (online edition).
Huge honor. Massive imposter syndrome. Zero interest in giving a boring "career advice" talk.
So instead, I shared something much simpler and honestly more real:
**A tiny ethical loop that’s been shaping my life for the last years:**

```
Learn → Build → Share
```

That’s it.
Three verbs.
But those three verbs carry a whole worldview behind them.
Let me explain.

## 1. The Harsh Problem

Peru has a strange cultural bug:

There'se a problem we don't like to admit out loud.

people learn in silence, build in silence, and disappear in silence.

No community.
No visibility.
No collaboration.

Everyone grinding solo like it’s their own Hunter Exam.

The result?

Opportunities don’t circulate because nobody knows what anyone else is doing.

So my whole talk was basically a 30-minute attempt at saying:

> Bro, show your work.
>
> It's not ego, it's contribution.

## 2. Learn, the good way

Learn, but actually _learn_, don't autocomplete your way through life.

I said this during the talk and could feel the silence:

> LLMs don't make you smarter.
>
> They just boost the smart people.

If you don’t understand the fundamentals, the model is thinking _for_ you.

You’re renting cognition.

Learning is the foundation.

Not for grades.

Not for a CV.

But because **understanding creates independence**.

If you skip this step, everything else collapses.

## 3. Build stuff

Most students don’t build projects because they’re terrified of:

- looking inexperienced,
- making something “too simple,”
- being judged,
- being wrong publicly.

I told them the truth I wish someone had told me earlier:

> You don't need permission to build.
>
> Just build.

Most of your growth comes from messing up.

Building is not the output — it’s the engine.

There is no pride in playing safe.

There is pride in iteration.

## 4. Share, no matter what

This is the hardest one for Peruvians.

Sharing feels like bragging.

Posting your work feels like showing off.

Talking publicly about projects feels like crossing a forbidden line.

But here's the thing:

> Sharing is not flexing.
>
> Sharing is multiplying.

Every time you publish:

- someone discovers you,
- someone learns from you,
- someone gets inspired,
- someone opens a door for you.

No community grows if everyone hides.

Nothing scales if you hide it.

## **5. And yes, I do want to stay in Peru**

I told them this exactly:

> I'm not leaving Peru so another country can benefit from my work.

> I want to absorb everything I can from the world and bring it back here.

I don’t think patriotism is pretending Peru is perfect.

Patriotism is wanting to fix the things that aren’t.

And the best way to fix anything is through **shared skill**, not lone genius.

## **6. The Loop That Built My Talk**

Here’s the whole philosophy in a single block:

```
Learn → so you understand.
Build → so you grow.
Share → so others grow with you.
```

Do those three things long enough, and it becomes more than a mindset —

it becomes an **ethic**.

One that’s badly needed here.

## **Closing Thoughts**

I didn't join the UNMSM event to talk about jobs, frameworks, or "how to break into tech."

I showed up to plant a seed:

**A new ethical loop for Peruvian engineering.**

Learn deeply.

Build relentlessly.

Share openly.

Repeat until the country changes.
