# **How To Setup Python + Jupyter Notebook + VS Code on Windows**

Setting up Python with Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code on a Windows machine is a straightforward process that will expand your data science capabilities. Here's a quick guide to get you started.

## **Step 1: Install Python**

Begin by downloading the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

During installation, ensure you select the checkbox that says **"Add Python to PATH"** to make Python accessible from the command line.

Verify that Python is installed by opening a new terminal window and typing **`python --version`**. You should see the version number of the Python installation you just installed.

```bash title="Terminal"
# Verify Python installation
python --version # Python 3.12.0

```

## **Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code**

Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Launch the application once installed.

## **Step 3: Install the Python Extension for VS Code**

In VS Code, navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon on the sidebar, or pressing **`Ctrl+Shift+X`**. Search for 'Python' and install the extension provided by Microsoft.

## **Step 4: Install Jupyter**

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code with **`Ctrl+`** and install the following libraries using pip:

```bash title="Terminal"
# Install Jupyter and other libraries
pip install jupyter opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```

## **Step 5: Create a Notebook**

Once Jupyter is installed, you can create a new notebook by clicking on the 'New File' icon and selecting 'Jupyter Notebook'.
Or simply create a new file with the **`.ipynb`** extension with the following content:

> Note:
> Make sure you have the `test.jpg` file in the same directory as the notebook.

```python title="01-images.ipynb"
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# read the image
img = cv2.imread('test.jpg')
# convert to RGB
img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
# plot the image
plt.imshow(img)
```

## **Step 6: Install and Select a Python Interpreter**

VS Code should prompt you to select a Python interpreter when you open a notebook. If not, you can select one by clicking on the Python version in the status bar at the bottom or using the command palette (**`Ctrl+Shift+P`**) and searching for "Python: Select Interpreter."

## **Step 7: Run Your First Cell**

Type some Python code into a cell, and then use **`Shift+Enter`** to execute the code and see the output below the cell.

## **Step 8: Optional - Run Jupyter Notebooks Locally**

Ne installed Jupyter in Step 4, so you can run the following command to start the notebook server:

```bash title="Terminal"
# Start the notebook server
jupyter notebook
```

# **Conclusion**

That's it! You now have a fully functional Python environment with Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code on Windows.

I have written this guide for Master's college students who are new to Python and Jupyter Notebooks. I hope you find it useful!
