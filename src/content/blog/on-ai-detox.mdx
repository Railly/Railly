We are delegating more and more thinking to artificial intelligence. **AI Detox is needed**. We tend to take the **path of least resistance**, but that makes us weak in the long run.

There's a special feeling when you do something on your own. Ask yourself: what would I be able to do if AI was globally shut down?

It's an extreme assumption, yes. But it's a good exercise to start reflecting on the *real* level of our skills. We need to be responsible AI users. We must **stop renting critical knowledge** and start internalizing and formulating it ourselves.

Otherwise, future generations will learn diluted knowledge or take everything for granted. And **when curiosity dies, so does the human spark**.

The joy of reading a book. Debugging on your own instead of jumping straight to the docs. Facing that cryptic error, finding the solution, and experiencing that *aha* moment.

I'm not saying reduce your AI usage, but allow yourself to see your most vulnerable side and say: I'll learn this deeply, **from first principles**, to produce a better output.
