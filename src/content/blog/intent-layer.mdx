Today I'm releasing **Intent Layer**, the first skill from [Crafter Station](https://crafterstation.com).

```bash
npx skills add crafter-station/skills --skill intent-layer -g
```

Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, and [10+ more agents](https://github.com/vercel-labs/add-skill#available-agents).

## The Problem

I've been using Claude Code daily for 3 months. Same model, same prompts—completely different results depending on the repo.

On a 2.5M token codebase I watched Claude:
- Burn 40k tokens exploring dead ends
- Find mocked tests, outdated docs, random utilities
- Miss the config file with the actual bug

Reasonable search. Wrong places. Bug still there.

## Why This Happens

Your best engineers don't grep randomly. They have a mental map:
- What each folder owns
- What breaks if you touch it wrong
- Where the real logic lives

That map took years to build. Your agents don't have it.

## What Intent Layer Does

The skill helps you set up `AGENTS.md` files at folder boundaries—simple markdown that gives agents the context they can't get from code alone:

```markdown
# Payment Service

## Purpose
Handles payment processing and settlement.
Does NOT own billing/invoicing (see billing-service).

## Rules
- All processor calls go through src/clients/processor.ts
- Settlement config lives in ../platform-config/rules/

## Warnings
- src/legacy/ looks dead but handles pre-2023 accounts
- Test mode hits real sandbox. Charges appear then void.
```

Run `/intent-layer` on your project and it:
1. Detects existing CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md files
2. Analyzes your codebase structure
3. Suggests where to add context nodes
4. Interviews you for the stuff code can't say

## Results

Same bug, with AGENTS.md in place:
- 16k tokens loaded (not 40k)
- Went straight to the config file
- Found it first try

The agent knew where to look because I told it.

## Try It

```bash
npx skills add crafter-station/skills --skill intent-layer -g
```

Or just create an `AGENTS.md` in your repo root. Start with purpose, rules, and warnings. See what happens.

## What's Next

This is the first skill in a series on context engineering:

- **model-router** - Haiku for simple, Sonnet for code, Opus for architecture
- **parallel-agents** - Overnight builds while you sleep
- **context-bundler** - Assemble task-specific context packs

All open source at [crafter-station/skills](https://github.com/crafter-station/skills).

## Credits

Built on [The Intent Layer](https://www.intent-systems.com/learn/intent-layer) by Tyler Brandt. His article covers hierarchical summarization, the LCA principle, and maintenance patterns. Start there for the full methodology.

Also related to my earlier [AI-First Manifesto](/writing/ai-first-manifesto) where I proposed `LLMS.md` files—Intent Layer is the evolved version of that idea.
