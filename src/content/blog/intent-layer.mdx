Today I'm releasing **`/intent-layer`**, the first skill from [Crafter Station](https://crafterstation.com).

```bash
npx skills add crafter-station/skills --skill intent-layer -g
```

Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, and [10+ more agents](https://github.com/vercel-labs/add-skill#available-agents).

## The Problem

I've been using Claude Code daily for 3 months. Same model, same prompts—completely different results depending on the repo.

On a 2.5M token codebase I watched Claude:

- Burn 40k tokens exploring dead ends
- Find mocked tests, outdated docs, random utilities
- Miss the config file with the actual bug

Reasonable search. Wrong places. Bug still there.

## Why This Happens

Your best engineers don't grep randomly. They have a mental map:

- What each folder owns
- What breaks if you touch it wrong
- Where the real logic lives

That map took years to build. Your agents don't have it.

## The Solution: Context Engineering

Context engineering is designing the full information an agent needs to perform reliably:

- System prompts and instructions
- Structured inputs and outputs
- Tools and their definitions
- RAG and memory systems

Intent Layer solves the first piece: **system prompt infrastructure**.

## What Intent Layer Does

The skill helps you set up `AGENTS.md` files at folder boundaries—simple markdown that gives agents the context they can't get from code alone:

```markdown
# Payment Service

## Purpose

Handles payment processing and settlement.
Does NOT own billing/invoicing (see billing-service).

## Rules

- All processor calls go through src/clients/processor.ts
- Settlement config lives in ../platform-config/rules/

## Warnings

- src/legacy/ looks dead but handles pre-2023 accounts
- Test mode hits real sandbox. Charges appear then void.
```

Run `/intent-layer` on your project and it:

1. Detects existing CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md files
2. Analyzes your codebase structure
3. Suggests where to add context nodes
4. Interviews you for the stuff code can't say

## Results

Same bug, with AGENTS.md in place:

- 16k tokens loaded (not 40k)
- Went straight to the config file
- Found it first try

The agent knew where to look because I told it.

## Try It

```bash
npx skills add crafter-station/skills --skill intent-layer -g
```

Or just create an `AGENTS.md` in your repo root. Start with purpose, rules, and warnings. See what happens.

## What's Next

Intent Layer is the first of several context engineering skills:

| Tier | Problem | Skill |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| Foundation | Agents grep in dark | `intent-layer` ✓ |
| Foundation | Agent reads too much | `context-bundler` |
| Foundation | System boundaries unclear | `architecture-map` |
| Capture | Rules are implicit | `invariants-capture` |
| Capture | Patterns undocumented | `contract-extractor` |
| Maintenance | Context drifts | `intent-maintenance` |
| Maintenance | Invariants not enforced | `contract-verifier` |

Plus **Stack Skills** for specific tools: Clerk, Vercel, Supabase, etc.

## Credits

Built on [The Intent Layer](https://www.intent-systems.com/learn/intent-layer) by Tyler Brandt. His [AI Adoption Roadmap](https://www.intent-systems.com/learn/ai-adoption-roadmap) maps the stages most teams are stuck at—start there for the full methodology.

Context engineering framework from [DAIR.AI](https://www.promptingguide.ai) and [LangChain](https://blog.langchain.com/the-rise-of-context-engineering/).

Also related to my earlier [AI-First Manifesto](/writing/ai-first-manifesto) where I proposed `LLMS.md` files—Intent Layer is the evolved version of that idea.
