**`/skill-gen`** is the second skill from [Crafter Station](https://crafterstation.com).

```bash
npx skills add crafter-station/skills --skill skill-gen -g
```

Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, and [10+ more agents](https://github.com/vercel-labs/add-skill#available-agents).

## The Problem

I needed skills for Clerk's API (webhooks, orgs, custom flows).

**Option 1**: Read docs, write `SKILL.md` by hand, hope I got the frontmatter right.

**Option 2**: Point an agent at the docs and let it extract what matters.

I picked option 2.

## How It Works

Give it a URL. It asks 3 clarifying questions (focus areas, use cases, workflow priorities). Then hits Firecrawl's agent endpoint to extract structured content.

Out comes a skill with:
- `SKILL.md` (frontmatter + instructions)
- `references/` (API patterns, examples, auth flows)
- Proper structure (validated, ready to use)

Ask Claude: `"Create a skill from clerk.com/docs/guides/development/webhooks"`

Claude runs `/skill-gen`, asks what endpoints matter, extracts the patterns, writes the skill. Done.

## Why This Matters

Skills are context engineering. They teach agents domain knowledge the model doesn't have.

But writing them from docs is grunt work:
- Read through pages
- Extract patterns
- Structure as `SKILL.md`
- Validate frontmatter
- Hope you didn't miss something

`skill-gen` automates the grunt work. You get the skill, the agent gets domain knowledge.

## The Meta Part

This is the first skill in a new category: **meta**.

Agent ecosystems need tools to build tools. `skill-gen` auto-generates skills from docs. Next:

- `skill-debugger` (why didn't it trigger?)
- `skill-analyzer` (token usage, activation patterns)
- `skill-marketplace` (publish, discover, version)

Infrastructure for AI-native development.

## Results

Used it to scaffold Clerk skills (`clerk-webhooks`, `clerk-orgs`, `clerk-custom-ui`). Gets you a solid starting point in 2-3 minutes.

<Callout type="warning" title="Still Needs Refinement">
The output needs refinement - critical thinking still required. But it beats staring at blank `SKILL.md` files.
</Callout>

**Before**: 30 minutes to extract patterns and write frontmatter.

**After**: 2 minutes for scaffold, 10 minutes to refine.

## Requirements

You need Firecrawl for this to work:

1. Get a free API key at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev) (5 free daily runs)
2. Set up the [Firecrawl MCP server](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-mcp)
3. Add your key to the MCP config

Each skill generation uses **5-15 credits** on the free tier, **15-50 credits** on pro. The free tier is enough to generate a few skills per day.

## Try It

```bash
npx skills add crafter-station/skills --skill skill-gen -g
```

Then ask Claude: `"Research Stripe webhooks and create a skill"` or `"Create a skill from stripe.com/docs/webhooks"`

## What's Next

Second skill in the Crafter Station marketplace:

1. **intent-layer** (context engineering) - AGENTS.md infrastructure
2. **skill-gen** (meta) - Auto-generate skills from docs

More coming soon.

## Credits

Inspired by [Firecrawl's guide](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/claude-code-skill) on Claude Code skills. Uses Firecrawl's agent endpoint for structured extraction.

Built in Peru 🇵🇪, tested on [Clerk skills](https://clerk.com/changelog/2026-01-29-clerk-skills).
