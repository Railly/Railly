**Skill Kit** is a CLI that scans your AI agent skills, tracks usage, and tells you what to keep and what to drop.

```bash
npx @crafter/skillkit scan
```

Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, and [10+ more agents](https://github.com/crafter-station/skill-kit#supported-agents).

## The Problem

The skills ecosystem is growing fast. Skills.sh, manual installs, project-level skills — they accumulate. Every skill gets loaded into the agent's context window on every session.

Context is a finite budget. Every unused skill steals tokens from your actual code.

But there's zero visibility:
- Which skills are actually being used?
- How much context budget are they consuming?
- Which ones haven't been invoked in months?

I use Claude Code daily at [Clerk](https://clerk.com) and for my open source work at [Crafter Station](https://crafterstation.com). I had 40+ skills installed across global and project scopes. No idea which ones mattered.

## The Solution

Skill Kit gives you five commands:

### scan

Discovers installed skills and indexes your session files.

```
$ skillkit scan
  Scanning ~/.claude/skills/ ...
  Found 12 skills (8 via skills.sh, 4 manual)
  Indexed 211 sessions · 1,847 invocations
```

It parses JSONL session files, looking for `Skill` tool_use blocks, and maps each invocation back to the skill that triggered it.

### stats

Usage analytics with sparkline trends over the last 30 days.

```
$ skillkit stats --top 3
  SKILL       30d   TREND
  commit      42    ▂▃▅▇█▆▅▇█
  review      38    ▁▃▅▆▇▇▆▅▃
  deploy      27    ▁▁▂▃▅▇█▇▅
```

### health

Context budget check. Flags unused skills.

```
$ skillkit health
  [████████░░] 78% metadata budget (12.5K / 16.0K)
  ! 3 skills unused in 30d — run skillkit prune
```

### prune

Removes skills that haven't been used in 30 days. Shows what you'll reclaim before confirming.

```
$ skillkit prune
  × scaffold (0.9K)
  × lint (2.1K)

  2 skills · 3.0K context reclaimable

  Run with --yes to confirm deletion.
```

### list

Lists all installed skills with size and installation method.

## How It Works

Everything runs locally. SQLite database at `~/.skillkit/analytics.db`. No telemetry, no network calls, nothing leaves your machine.

The scanner walks `~/.claude/skills/` (and equivalent paths for other agents), reads SKILL.md files, and detects whether each skill was installed via skills.sh or manually. It deduplicates symlinked skills across agents.

For usage data, it parses JSONL session files from `~/.claude/projects/`. Each session file contains tool_use blocks — when a `Skill` tool is invoked, Skill Kit maps the skill name back to an installed skill and records the invocation.

Sparklines are generated from 30-day invocation data, bucketed daily. The health check calculates total metadata bytes across all loaded skills and compares against the 16K context budget.

## Use as a Skill

You can also install Skill Kit as a Claude Code skill itself:

```bash
npx skills add crafter-station/skill-kit
```

Then ask your agent: "which skills do I use the most?" or "clean up unused skills" and it runs the right commands.

## Try It

```bash
npx @crafter/skillkit scan
npx @crafter/skillkit stats
npx @crafter/skillkit health
```
