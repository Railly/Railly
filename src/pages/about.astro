                I'm Hunter, a software engineer focused on developer tools, UI systems, and AI-powered workflows.

                I work at Clerk on the AI Enablement team. I'm also part of Crafter Station, teach at UNMSM, and collaborate with the Midudev team.

                I'm interested in how tools shape thinking. Good DX isn't decoration, it's leverage. Most of my projects explore that idea through code, design, and open source.

            <p class="text-flexoki-tx-2 leading-relaxed">
                Outside of work, I travel, take photos, and learn from people who build things in the open.
