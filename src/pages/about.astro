                        Hey! I'm Railly Hugo, a software engineer focused on
                        building developer tools and AI-powered experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-flexoki-tx-2 leading-relaxed">
                        I work at Clerk on the AI Enablement Team, contribute to
                        Crafter Station, and teach at UNMSM. I'm also part of the
                        Midudev Team.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-flexoki-tx-2 leading-relaxed">
                        I love creating tools that make developers' lives easier.
                        Some of my projects include Elements (full-stack shadcn
                        components), text0 (AI-powered text editor), and Tinte (a
                        multiplatform theme builder).
                    </p>
            <p class="text-flexoki-tx-2 leading-relaxed">
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new places, taking
                photos, and learning from amazing people in the tech
                community.
