                    Hey! I'm Railly Hugo, a software engineer focused on
                    building developer tools and AI-powered experiences.

                <p class="text-flexoki-tx-2 leading-relaxed">
                    I work at Clerk on the AI Enablement Team, contribute to
                    Crafter Station, and teach at UNMSM. I'm also part of the
                    Midudev Team.
                </p>
                <p class="text-flexoki-tx-2 leading-relaxed">
                    I love creating tools that make developers' lives easier.
                    Some of my projects include Elements (full-stack shadcn
                    components), text0 (AI-powered text editor), and Tinte (a
                    multiplatform theme builder).

                <p class="text-flexoki-tx-2 leading-relaxed">
                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new places, taking
                    photos, and learning from amazing people in the tech
                    community.
